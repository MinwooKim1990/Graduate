### Cointegration exercise

A lecture on the topic of cointegration accompanies this exercise. For the exericse, you should first analyze a dataset 
to come up with a viable trading model. A strategy based on this model should then be implemented to run against the 
Optibook exchange. 

For the analysis it is recommended to use a Jupyter notebook and the well-known Python package pandas for loading and 
visualizing the data. Combining this package with the cointegration-related functions provided in the 
cointegration_analysis module in this directory, a full cointegration analysis can be ran on the provided dataset. A 
notebook which displays how to load the data into a Pandas dataframe has been provided in this folder.

NOTE: To use Jupyter, use the command 'start_jupyter' in a Terminal window (Window -> New Terminal) and browse to
one of the provided addresses to access the notebooks.
